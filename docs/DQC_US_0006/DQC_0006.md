# DEI and Block Tag Date Contexts 
Rule ID: DQC_0006

## Rule function

This rule tests that the dates used for certain Document and Entity Information, accounting policy, text block and table text block elements are consistent with the fiscal period focus of the filing (e.g. Q1, Q2, Q3 or FY). 

In general, filings cover quarterly and annual periods in roughly 90 day increments. Due to allowable variations in reporting period length, filing periods may be more or less than the standard increment. The increments tested for each filing period are as follows:

	Q1	77 to 119 days

	Q2	154 to 204 days

	Q3	238 to 287 days

	FY	350 to 379 days

The following Document and Entity Information elements are included in this test:

	Amendment Description
	Amendment Flag
	Current Fiscal Year End Date
	Document Period End Date
	Document Fiscal Year Focus
	Document Fiscal Period Focus
	Document Type
	Entity Registrant Name
	Entity Central Index Key
	Entity Filer Category

This rule does not test any non numeric items that are not text block, table text block, and accounting policy elements.

## Authoritative reference

EDGAR Filer Manual 6.6.1; EDGAR Filer Manual 6.6.2 requires the dates for text blocks, table text blocks, and accounting policy elements must be the current reporting period. This is true even when the information in the text blocks, table text blocks or accounting policies relates to a prior period.

## Problem solved by the rule

Filers apply incorrect reporting dates to elements. This error impacts the consumption of the elements because users will extract the data based on the expected reporting date.  

## Example rule message

## For Developers

The Global Rule Logic document contains general guidelines for implementation of rules.

The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter's value is to occur.
